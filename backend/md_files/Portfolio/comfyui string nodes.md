Key Features:

1. String Manipulation Nodes:
    - StringSplitter: Splits a multi-line string input into individual strings.
    - UnzipStrings: Unpacks zipped strings for further processing.
    - StringCombinations: Generates combinations of strings from two input lists.

1. File Operations:
    - FileCounter: Counts the number of files in a specified directory.

2. Input Construction:
    - InputStringConstructor: Builds complex file paths based on multiple input parameters.

3. Flexible Input Types:
    - Supports various input types including strings, integers, floats, and selections.

4. Custom Node Categories:
    - Organizes nodes into logical categories for easy access in the ComfyUI interface.

5. Output Handling:
    - Provides single and multiple output options, including list outputs.

Key Technologies:

1. Python: The core language used for implementing the node functionalities.
2. ComfyUI API: Utilizes ComfyUI's node creation and integration system.
3. Object-Oriented Programming: Employs class-based structure for each node type.
4. Git: Version control system used for managing the project.
5. OS Module: Used for file system operations in the FileCounter node.

This project demonstrates proficiency in creating modular, extensible software components, understanding of GUI frameworks, and ability to enhance existing systems with custom functionality. It showcases skills in Python programming, API integration, and developing tools for complex workflows in the field of AI and image processing.
