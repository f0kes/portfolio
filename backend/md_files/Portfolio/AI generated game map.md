This project exemplifies my ability to take a game map from initial concept to a highly detailed, production-ready asset. By combining traditional design techniques with cutting-edge AI tools and custom software development, I've created a workflow that produces exceptional results efficiently.
1. i drew a game map with all the objectives in place

2. my wife modelled the objectives i placed them on a map![[../Pasted image 20240928003543.png]]
3. i rendered a segmentation map, line map, depth map and normal map![[../map_depth.png]]
4. i rendered a base map with stable diffusion with colors i liked![[../map_small.png]]
5. i upscaled with tiled diffusion to 20k
