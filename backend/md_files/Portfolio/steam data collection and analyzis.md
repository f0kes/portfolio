Steam Game Recommendation System
[github](https://github.com/f0kes/steam)
This project implements a sophisticated recommendation system for Steam games using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques. Key features include:

- Data collection and preprocessing of Steam user playtime data using PostgreSQL and Python
- Latent space analysis using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Custom flow-based algorithm to identify game transition patterns
- Integration with Steam API to fetch up-to-date game information

The system analyzes millions of user-game interactions to generate personalized game recommendations and identify trending games. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to capture complex patterns in gaming preferences and behavior.

Key technologies used:

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- PyTorch
- Steam Web API

This project demonstrates skills in:

- Large-scale data processing and analysis
- Designing and implementing recommender systems
- Applied machine learning and matrix factorization
- Working with APIs and external data sources
- Software engineering best practices

The codebase includes data preprocessing scripts, model implementations, evaluation metrics, and Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization. The system architecture is designed to be scalable to handle large volumes of Steam user data.
